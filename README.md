Description:

A fun and interactive two-player dice game built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game includes dynamic UI updates and engaging gameplay mechanics, where players take turns rolling a dice to accumulate points. If a player rolls a 1, their turn ends, and they lose the points for that round. Players can choose to 'Hold' to save their current score, aiming to be the first to reach the winning score of 100. This project demonstrates practical JavaScript skills and the ability to implement game logic and responsive design.
